# Password Vault

By Darren Fernandes

The password vault was built using the sqllite and the hashes library in python to ecnrypt the database of password. The reason for Symmetric Key Encryption is to show how should an attacker gain access to the database the data present in there will not be viewable as it has been encrypted using the sha256 encryption standard. This is a basic password vault which makes use of a local database and tkinter for the GUI.
